### R1D2 - April 21, Tuesday

Today's Progress: Started third responsive design project on FreeCodeCamp. I am confident about writing near perfect semantic HTML. But CSS is something else. It takes so much time! Appealing design is not easy. Switched my reading to "Clean Code"

### R1D3 - April 22, Wednesday

Today's Progress: Submitted third responsive design project on FreeCodeCamp. Page looks ugly. But I have decided to move on. Cohesive and complete design is definitely a whole another discipline. Maybe I will visit this ugly page again at a later date. Read some more "Clean Code".

### R1D4 - April 23, Thursday

Today's Progress: Finished 4th html/css project on @freeCodeCamp. Overall it was good and felt like I am getting more comfortable writing CSS. This was the first day of a 4 day lockdown in Turkey so I felt a little low. It affected me a little.

### R1D5 - April 24, Friday

Today's Progress: First day of Ramadan. Not a very productive day. Read some more from "Clean Code". Started to look into blazor web assembly.

### R1D6 - April 25, Saturday

Today's Progress: I submitted last project and claimed my certificate from @freeCodeCamp. FreeCodeCamp is really a great user experience. And for free! I will comeback to these projects and beautify them in time. For the moment, I am satisfied with the progress.

### R1D17 - May 07, Thursday -- R1D19 May 09, Saturday

Today's Progress: I took longer than I anticipated. Some of the challenges took really long time to figure them out. Coming up with a bulletproof working algorithm and trying to code it in was very challenging and also very educating. I finished intermediate exercises on May 09th. Hopefully, I will complete projects tomorrow and claim the certificate.
