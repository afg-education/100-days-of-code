### R1D2 - April 21, Tuesday

Today's Progress: Started third responsive design project on FreeCodeCamp. I am confident about writing near perfect semantic HTML. But CSS is something else. It takes so much time! Appealing design is not easy. Switched my reading to "Clean Code"

### R1D3 - April 22, Wednesday

Today's Progress: Submitted third responsive design project on FreeCodeCamp. Page looks ugly. But I have decided to move on. Cohesive and complete design is definitely a whole another discipline. Maybe I will visit this ugly page again at a later date. Read some more "Clean Code".

### R1D4 - April 23, Thursday

Today's Progress: Finished 4th html/css project on @freeCodeCamp. Overall it was good and felt like I am getting more comfortable writing CSS. This was the first day of a 4 day lockdown in Turkey so I felt a little low. It affected me a little.

### R1D6 - April 25, Saturday

### R1D17 - May 07, Thursday -- R1D19 May 09, Saturday

Today's Progress: I took longer than I anticipated. Some of the challenges took really long time to figure them out. Coming up with a bulletproof working algorithm and trying to code it in was very challenging and also very educating. I finished intermediate exercises on May 09th. Hopefully, I will complete projects tomorrow and claim the certificate.

### ###### May 11, Monday - Completed Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification

### R1D22 - May 12, Tuesday -- R1D25 May 15, Friday

Today's Progress: Started Front End Libraries Certification on @freeCodeCamp and worked through Bootstrap, Jquery, Sass and React sections. Read some more. Organized my files, bookmarks, trello boards. Tended to my garden. Baked breads, tried making pizza for the first time. Getting excited with the idea to stream on Twitch. 

### R1D25 - May 16, Saturday -- R1D25 May 18, Monday : 

Today's Progress: I say, off days. Had to format my PC. Worked on my garden, spent time with my family. I did read, solved couple of codewars katas, watched some coding related streams nonetheless. From this point forward, I will commit to spending min. 1 hour to a project. First one will be the portfolio website.

### R1D26 - May 19, Tuesday -- R1D29 May 22, Friday :

Today's Progress: I have completed React, Redux, React and Redux Sections on @freeCodeCamp. Started working on a twitch bot, connected to Twitch API. Started working on a Game Suggestion App from app-ideas list of @florinpop17. 

### R1D30 - May 23, Saturday -- R1D35 May 28, Thursday :

Today's Progress: Overall not very productive through these days. Ramadan, Celebration, then some COVID related daily stress prevented me to study and worked efficiently. Still I did follow along Brad's HTML course on Udemy, did some planning for my website, learned a little bit more about React.

### R1D36 - May 29, Friday -- R1D37 May 30, Saturday :

Today's Progress: I worked on first project on Front End Libraries module of FreeCodeCamp. I realize now, that I solved it pretty quickly using React, but missing one tiny '#' in a tag's href attribute caused the page loading on every button click; which made me believe that somehow React component is rendering again, etc. Spent many hours just to understand why component is re-rendering, refactored countlessly and some more crazy stuff. After all the fuss, I felt so disconnected, I just left it without any CSS. You can say that I learned quite a bit from the experience.
